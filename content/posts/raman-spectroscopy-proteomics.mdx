Most of what we know about the proteome comes from mass spectrometry. It's extraordinarily powerful — modern instruments can quantify tens of thousands of proteins from a single sample, with peptide-level resolution. But it requires lysis. The cell is destroyed to measure what was inside it.

This is a fundamental limitation. The proteome is not a static snapshot. It's a dynamic system, responsive to mechanical forces, cell-cell contacts, metabolic state, and position within a tissue. When you lyse a cell to measure it, you've erased the very context that made the measurement meaningful.

Raman spectroscopy offers a different bargain.

## What Raman measures

When a photon strikes a molecule and scatters inelastically, it exits with a different energy than it entered — shifted by an amount corresponding to a vibrational mode of the molecule. This is the Raman effect. The resulting spectrum is, in a very real sense, a molecular fingerprint: each chemical bond vibrates at characteristic frequencies, and the spectrum encodes the sum of all of them.

For a cell, the Raman spectrum integrates signal from everything: lipids, nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and proteins. The protein contribution dominates at most laser wavelengths. Amide bonds, aromatic side chains, disulfide bridges — all of these have distinct spectral signatures that, in principle, encode something about protein identity, secondary structure, and post-translational modification.

The catch has always been interpretation. A raw Raman spectrum from a cell is a dense, overlapping superposition of thousands of molecular signals. Traditional analysis — peak fitting, principal component analysis — can cluster cell types or detect gross compositional differences, but it can't decode the spectrum into the protein-level information that biologists actually want.

## Where deep learning enters

The key insight that my work builds on is that the mapping from proteome to Raman spectrum is a physical process — it's determined by quantum mechanics and molecular geometry. It's complex, but it's not random. If you have enough paired data — Raman spectra and corresponding proteomic measurements from the same cells — a neural network should be able to learn that mapping.

This is easier said than done. The variability in single-cell Raman spectra is substantial, driven by cell cycle state, spatial orientation in the laser focus, and subcellular heterogeneity. The signal-to-noise ratio at single-cell resolution, especially for low-abundance proteins, is unforgiving.

Our approach has been to frame this as a structured prediction problem. Rather than trying to predict full proteomic profiles from spectra, we start with a simpler question: given a spectrum, can we classify the cell's functional state? Can we distinguish a naive T cell from an activated one? A quiescent fibroblast from one undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition?

The answer, with appropriate model architectures and careful data collection, is yes — with accuracy that competes with flow cytometry and without any fluorescent labels.

## The non-destructive advantage

What makes this genuinely exciting, beyond the classification accuracy, is what non-destructive measurement enables.

If you can phenotype a cell without killing it, you can track it over time. You can measure the same cell before and after a perturbation. You can select cells with specific phenotypes for downstream culture. You can map cell states spatially across tissue sections without the batch effects that plague proteomics workflows.

There's also an application in manufacturing contexts — cell therapy, cultivated meat, bioreactor monitoring — where you want to continuously measure cell state without perturbing the culture. Raman spectroscopy is already used for this at the bulk level. Single-cell resolution would enable much more precise process control.

## Current limitations and honest assessment

The technology has real limitations that I try not to paper over.

Throughput is the biggest one. A confocal Raman measurement of a single cell takes seconds to minutes, depending on desired signal-to-noise. Flow cytometry can process thousands of cells per second. For applications that need large numbers of cells, Raman spectroscopy is not going to compete on throughput anytime soon.

The depth of proteomic information is also genuinely uncertain. Raman is most sensitive to abundant proteins and dominant structural motifs. Low-abundance signaling proteins — the transcription factors and kinases that drive cellular decisions — may simply not contribute enough signal to be detectable above noise. The limits of what's recoverable from a spectrum are not fully mapped.

And the models are black boxes in the usual sense. Interpretability work — understanding which spectral features are driving predictions — is tractable and important, but it's a separate research problem from building the classifier.

## Why I think it's worth pursuing

Despite those caveats, I keep coming back to a simple observation: we don't have a good way to measure cell state in real time, non-invasively, at single-cell resolution. The technologies that exist either require labels (flow cytometry, imaging with fluorescent reporters), destroy the cell (mass cytometry, single-cell sequencing), or can't resolve individual cells (bulk spectroscopy, metabolic flux analysis).

Raman is imperfect. But it's the closest thing we have to a readout of the intracellular environment that doesn't require you to intervene in the system you're trying to measure. That's a rare property, and it's worth investing in making it work better.

The combination of better optics, more systematic paired datasets, and increasingly capable neural architectures is moving the field faster than I expected when I started this work. I think single-cell Raman spectroscopy will be a routine tool in cell biology labs within a decade. The question is whether the models will be interpretable enough by then to actually teach us biology, or whether they'll remain useful-but-opaque classifiers.

I'm betting on interpretable. That's most of what keeps me in the lab.
